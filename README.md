            <h1>History of the New York Mets</h1>

            <p> Back in 1961, the New York Mets had competed in their first season in the national league and at first, they were not really any good.
                The word met was short for metropolitan which means city. The following year, the Mets went <strong>40-120</strong> which was the second worst record
                in all of major league history. They made their first World Series run back in <strong>1969</strong> and won. They later returned to the World Series
                in <strong>1986</strong> and also won. Since then, the Mets have been looking for their third World Series title.
